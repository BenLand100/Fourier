I had entirely intended to write a speech synthesis library, but ended up 
abandoning it for better uses of my time. The left over bits consisted of a 
pretty nice GUI for playing with fourier transforms of sounds and generating
sounds from those transforms. It's worth a look if you're interested in that 
sort of thing.
